\paragraph{(a)}
The farthest distance between two points within a 
$\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2}$ square is 
$\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}<1$. 
Then FCC must reject the set of requests if two requests are in or 
on the boundary of the same square. 

\paragraph{(b)}
The problem is that given two lists of points $(x,y)$: 
$L_x$ and $L_y$, sorted by $x$ coordinate and $y$ coordinate respectively, 
and contain the same set of points, 
we wish to check whether there are two points within Euclidean distance 1. 
\\
To solve this problem, we first find $L_x[\frac{n}{2}]$, 
and devide $L_x$ into $L_x_l$ and $L_x_r$, 
based on whether a point is before or after $L_x[\frac{n}{2}]$ in $L_x$. 
Then we get the corresponding $L_y_l$ and $L_y_r$, by going through 
$L_y$. 
Then check the left half and the right half seperately. 
If both sides return true, we need to check whether there is a point from the left 
and a point from the right that the Euclidean distance between them is less than 1. 
We can do this by finding all points whose $x$ coordinate is within $\frac{1}{2}$ 
of $L_x[\frac{n}{2}]$'s $x$ coordinate and putting them in a list $L'$ with 
increasing $y$ coordinate (we can do so by going through $L_y$). 
Calculate the Euclidean distances between neighboring points in $L'$: $L'[0]$ and $L'[1]$, ... . 
If there is a pair whose distance is less than 1, return true; else, return false. 
\\
Let's prove that only checking neighboring points works. 
Otherwise,  we can find $L'[i]$ and $L'[j]$, $j-i>1$, 
and the distance between them is less than 1; 
while the distance between $L'[i]$ and $L'[i+1]$, the distance between $L'[i+1]$ and $L'[j]$ are both greater than 1 
(if the distance between $L'[i+1]$ and $L'[j]$ is less than 1, replace $L'[i]$ with $L'[i+1]$). 
Then in the triangle formed by $L'[i]$, $L'[i+1]$ and $L'[j]$, the angle of 
$L'[i]-L'[i+1]-L'[j]$ must be less than $\frac{\pi}{3}$.  
As we have checked points of the same side before, 
$L'[i]$ and $L'[j]$ must be from diferrent side of $L_x[\frac{n}{2}]$. 
Then $L'[i+1]$ is at the same side with either $L'[i]$ or $L'[j]$, 
which indicates that the distance between $x$ coordinates is less than $\frac{1}{2}$, 
then the distance between $y$ coordinates is greater than $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$. 
Then the angle made by either $L'[i]L'[i+1]$ or $L'[i+1]L'[j]$ with $x$ axis is greater than $\frac{\pi}{3}$, 
which contradicts with what we got before. 
\\
As all we do every time is going through $L_y$ twice, we have
$$T(n) = 2 T(\frac{n}{2}) + O(n)$$
Then the overall running time is $O(n\lg{n})$.
